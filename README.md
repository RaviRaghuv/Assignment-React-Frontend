2. Use Node.js version 16 or higher
3. Enable ESLint and Prettier in your editor

### Project Configuration
1. Environment Variables (create `.env` file):
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_ENV=development
```

2. Configure MSW for API mocking:
```javascript
// In src/mocks/browser.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'
import { handlers } from './handlers'
export const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)
```

### Adding New Features
1. Create components in appropriate directories
2. Use established patterns for forms and API calls
3. Follow the existing naming conventions
4. Add proper error handling and loading states
5. Update seed data if needed

### Code Style Guide
1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Implement proper TypeScript types/interfaces
3. Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
4. Write JSDoc comments for functions
5. Create unit tests for new features

### Database Operations
```javascript
// Use DatabaseService for all operations
import { DatabaseService } from '../services/database';

// Create
const job = await DatabaseService.createJob(data);

// Read
const jobs = await DatabaseService.getJobs(filters);

// Update
const updated = await DatabaseService.updateJob(id, changes);

// Delete
await DatabaseService.deleteJob(id);
```

### API Integration
```javascript
// Use MSW handlers for API simulation
import { rest } from 'msw';

// Add new endpoints to handlers.js
export const newHandlers = [
  rest.get('/api/new-endpoint', async (req, res, ctx) => {
    // Implementation
  }),
];
```
